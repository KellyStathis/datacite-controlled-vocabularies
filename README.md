# [DataCite Controlled Vocabulary](http://purl.org/datacite/v4.4/)

Controlled vocabularies allow an accurate and controlled approach in describing physical and digital assets (e.g., data). One of such controlled vocabulary is **DataCite Controlled Vocabulary**. This controlled vocabulary is produced based on description of [Datacite Schema V4.4](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.4/). The work of creating this controlled vocabulary is part of [FAIRware project](https://researchonresearch.org/projects#!/tab/273951116-3) which if funded by [RoRi](https://researchonresearch.org/).

`sheet2rdf` and `OntoStack`, are used to build and serve **DataCite Controlled Vocabulary**, while [PURL](https://archive.org/services/purl/), is used to persist identifiers for the vocabulary:

# Tooling

## [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/327900313.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/327900313) sheet2rdf

This repository hosts automatic workflow, executed by means of Github actions, and underlying shell and python scripts which:

- Fetches Google Sheet from Google Drive and stores is as `xlsx` and `csv` files
- Converts fetched sheet to machine-actionable and FAIR RDF vocabulary using [xls2rdf](https://github.com/sparna-git/xls2rdf)
- Tests the resulting RDF vocabulary using [qSKOS](https://github.com/cmader/qSKOS/)
- Commits conversion results and tests logs to this repository
- and deploy RDF vocabulary to OntoStack to be served to humans and machines

This workflow is an extension of [excel2rdf](https://github.com/fair-data-collective/excel2rdf-template).

### Configuring sheet2rdf

In case you want to use **sheet2rdf** in your own work you need to:

1. Follow [gsheets](https://pypi.org/project/gsheets/) Quickstart and generate client_secrets.json and storage:

- When generating credentials, use type "Desktop App" (formerly "Other").

2. Create following [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets):

## OntoStack

OntoStack is a set of orchestrated micro-services configured and interfaced such that they can intake vocabularies and resolve their terms and RDF properties upon requests either by humans or machines.

Some of OntoStack micro-services are:

- [Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) a graph database
- [SKOSMOS](http://www.skosmos.org/) a web-based SKOS browser acting as a front-end for the vocabularies persisted by the graph database
- [Tr√¶fik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) an edge router responsible for proper serving of URL requests

Currently three instances of OntoStack are available:

- Departamental instance of [DTU Wind Energy](https://www.vindenergi.dtu.dk/english/): http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/ontologies
- National (Danish) instance ran by [DeiC](https://deic.dk/): http://ontology.deic.dk/
- International instance ran by [FAIR Data Collective](http://fairdatacollective.org/): http://vocab.fairdatacollective.org
